Leverage your knowledge of the JavaScript programming language to write a function that checks the input of a user's name for the proper format.

The function should check for:

    The first letter of both first name and last name should be capitalized.
    The user must enter more than one character for first name and last name.
    No special characters should be available.

Your HTML page should include instructions based on your function. For example:

<h1>Please Enter Your First and Last Name</h1>
