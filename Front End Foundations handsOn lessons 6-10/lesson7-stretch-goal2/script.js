/* Leverage your knowledge of AJAX to create a web page that displays a famous historical figure with a header and a button when clicked displays more information about the historical figure.

For example:

If you chose Einstein, there should be:

    A header with his name,
    A picture of Einstein,
    A button to "Learn More" and
    A paragraph about Einstein that is displayed once the button is clicked.

This will require you to create a separate .txt file to store your information. */
